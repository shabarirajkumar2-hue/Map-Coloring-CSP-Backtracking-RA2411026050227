## Live Demo

Access the deployed interactive Map Coloring CSP system here:

https://map-coloring-csp-backtracking.onrender.com/login

This live deployment demonstrates the Map Coloring Problem Solver using Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) and Backtracking Search with rule validation, explanation engine, execution history tracking, and structured PDF report generation.

The system allows users to register, login, solve map coloring problems using CSP constraints, view step-by-step reasoning, and generate explainable reports for academic evaluation and project presentation.

## 📌 Problem Description

The **Map Coloring Problem** is a classic Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) where:
- A map consists of **regions**
- Adjacent regions must be assigned **different colors**
- The goal is to color all regions using the **minimum number of colors** such that no two neighboring regions share the same color

This is equivalent to the **Graph Coloring Problem** in graph theory and has real-world applications in:
- Frequency assignment in wireless networks
- Register allocation in compilers
- Scheduling problems
- Sudoku solving

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

### Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) — Backtracking Search

The solver uses a combination of three techniques:

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Backtracking Search** | Recursively assigns colors to regions; undoes assignments when a conflict is detected |
| **MRV Heuristic** | Minimum Remaining Values — selects the region with the fewest legal color options next |
| **LCV Heuristic** | Least Constraining Value — tries the color that restricts neighbors the least |

### Algorithm Flow

```
1. Select unassigned region (MRV heuristic)
2. Order available colors (LCV heuristic)
3. For each color:
   a. Check adjacency constraints (is_consistent)
   b. If valid → assign color, recurse
   c. If recursion succeeds → return solution
   d. Else → undo assignment (backtrack), try next color
4. If no color works → return failure (propagates up)
5. If all regions assigned → return solution
```

## 🗃️ Database Schema

### `users` Table

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | INTEGER PK | Auto-increment ID |
| name | VARCHAR(120) | Full name |
| username | VARCHAR(80) UNIQUE | Login username |
| password | VARCHAR(256) | Hashed password (Werkzeug) |
| created_at | DATETIME | Registration timestamp |

### `map_executions` Table

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | INTEGER PK | Auto-increment ID |
| user_id | INTEGER FK | References users.id |
| regions_json | TEXT | JSON array of region names |
| neighbors_json | TEXT | JSON dict of adjacency |
| colors_json | TEXT | JSON array of colors |
| solution_json | TEXT | JSON dict of solution |
| confidence_score | FLOAT | 0–100 algorithm confidence |
| complexity_label | VARCHAR | LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH |
| backtracks | INTEGER | Backtracking steps taken |
| elapsed_ms | FLOAT | Execution time in ms |
| success | BOOLEAN | Whether solution was found |
| timestamp | DATETIME | Execution time |

---

## 📊 Confidence Score Logic

The confidence score (0–100%) is calculated as:

```python
base_score          = 100.0
backtrack_penalty   = min(backtracks * 2, 30)   # max 30 points off
constraint_bonus    = (satisfied / total) * 20

confidence = base_score - backtrack_penalty + (constraint_bonus - 20)
confidence = clamp(confidence, 0, 100)
```

| Score Range | Complexity Label |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Low backtracks + few regions | LOW COMPLEXITY MAP |
| Medium backtracks | MEDIUM COMPLEXITY MAP |
| High backtracks + many regions | HIGH COMPLEXITY MAP |

## 🌐 Sample Execution

### Input

```
Regions:   A, B, C, D, E
Colors:    Red, Green, Blue
Adjacency:
  A → B, C
  B → A, C, D
  C → A, B, D, E
  D → B, C, E
  E → C, D
```

### Output

```
STEP 1:  Trying Red for Region A
STEP 2:  Assigned Red to Region A ✓
STEP 3:  Trying Red for Region B
STEP 4:  Conflict: Red already used by adjacent region of B
STEP 5:  Trying Green for Region B
STEP 6:  Assigned Green to Region B ✓
STEP 7:  Trying Red for Region C
STEP 8:  Conflict detected
STEP 9:  Trying Blue for Region C
STEP 10: Assigned Blue to Region C ✓
...

Final Solution:
  A → Red
  B → Green
  C → Blue
  D → Red
  E → Green
```

## 🌍 Deployment on Render

### 1. Create `render.yaml` (optional) or configure manually:

- **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command:** `gunicorn app:app`
- **Environment Variable:** `SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key`

### 2. Port Binding (already configured in `app.py`):

```python

port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 5000))
app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=port)
```

### 3. Push to GitHub and connect to Render.
